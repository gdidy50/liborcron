# LIBORCRON

A small NodeJS server that uses [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to grab a screenshot of the daily LIBOR rates from the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds) and [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/cme-group-benchmark-administration/term-sofr.html) and provides a download link.
