# LIBORCRON

A small NodeJS script that uses [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) and [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) to grab a screenshot of the daily LIBOR rates from the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds) and send out an email with the screenshot as an attachment.
